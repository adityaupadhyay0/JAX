This document contains a comprehensive audit of the AXE project, focusing on the completion status of tasks outlined in Phases 1 through 4 of the `todo.md` file. This report supersedes all previous audit documents.

## ✅ PHASE 1: Basic Tensor Ops

### Setup
- **Create GitHub repo**: ❓ (Cannot be verified from within the codebase)
- **Setup CMake build**: ✅ (Verified in `CMakeLists.txt` and `cpp/CMakeLists.txt`)
- **Add pybind11 dependency**: ✅ (Verified in `cpp/CMakeLists.txt` using `FetchContent`)
- **Configure GitHub Actions CI**: ✅ (Verified by the presence of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Add pytest + Google Test**: ✅ (Verified. `pytest` is in `requirements.txt` and Google Test is integrated via `FetchContent` in `cpp/CMakeLists.txt`)

### C++ Core
- **Create `Tensor` class with shape/dtype**: ✅ (Implemented in `cpp/include/tensor.h`)
- **Implement reference counting**: ✅ (A manual reference count is implemented in `cpp/tensor.cpp`)
- **Add CPU/GPU device enum**: ✅ (Implemented in `cpp/include/tensor.h`, but GPU functionality is not supported)
- **Write basic memory allocator**: ⚠️ (The implementation uses `malloc` and `free` directly. This is functional but not a custom or optimized allocator)
- **Add `zeros()`, `ones()`, `arange()`**: ✅ (Implemented as static methods in `cpp/tensor.cpp`)

### Python API
- **Wrap Tensor class with pybind11**: ✅ (The `Tensor` class is wrapped in `cpp/pybind.cpp`)
- **Support NumPy array protocol**: ✅ (The buffer protocol is implemented in `cpp/pybind.cpp`, enabling zero-copy sharing)
- **Add `axe.array()` function**: ✅ (Implemented in `python/axe.py`)
- **Enable `.numpy()` conversion**: ✅ (A dedicated `.numpy()` method is bound in `cpp/pybind.cpp`)

### Test
- **Can create tensors on CPU**: ✅ (Verified by tests in `tests/test_tensor.py`)
- **Can create tensors on GPU**: ❌ (The constructor in `cpp/tensor.cpp` explicitly throws an error for GPU devices)
- **NumPy interop works**: ✅ (Verified by tests in `tests/test_tensor.py` and `tests/test_ops.py`)

## ✅ PHASE 2: Basic Math Ops

### C++ Implementation
- **Add `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`**: ✅ (Implemented in `cpp/tensor.cpp`)
- **Add `matmul` using Eigen**: ✅ (Implemented in `cpp/tensor.cpp` and linked via `FetchContent` in `cpp/CMakeLists.txt`)
- **Add `sum`, `mean`, `max`**: ✅ (Implemented in `cpp/tensor.cpp`)
- **Add broadcasting logic**: ✅ (A complete broadcasting implementation is present in `cpp/tensor.cpp`)
- **Write CUDA kernels for GPU**: ❌ (No GPU support or CUDA code found)

### Python Operators
- **Override `__add__`, `__mul__`, etc**: ✅ (The `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, and `__truediv__` operators are bound in `cpp/pybind.cpp`)
- **Support `@` for matmul**: ✅ (The `__matmul__` operator is implemented and bound)
- **Add `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.max()` methods**: ✅ (Methods are implemented on the `Tensor` class and bound in `cpp/pybind.cpp`)

### Test
- **All ops work on CPU**: ✅ (Verified by tests in `tests/test_ops.py`)
- **All ops work on GPU**: ❌ (No GPU support)
- **Broadcasting works correctly**: ✅ (Verified by `test_broadcasting` in `tests/test_ops.py`)
- **Benchmark vs NumPy**: ❌ (No benchmark tests found in the repository)

## ✅ PHASE 3: Autodiff Basics

### C++ Autodiff
- **Create `Variable` class with grad**: ✅ (Implemented in `cpp/include/variable.h` and `cpp/variable.cpp`)
- **Build computation graph (tape)**: ✅ (A robust computation graph is implemented. `Variable` objects store a `creator` pointer to the `Operation` that produced them)
- **Implement `backward()` method**: ✅ (Implemented in `cpp/variable.cpp` with a topological sort of the computation graph)
- **Add gradients for: add, mul, matmul**: ✅ (Implemented in `cpp/op.cpp` with backward passes for `AddOp`, `MulOp`, `MatMulOp`, `SubOp`, and `SumOp`)
- **Handle in-place operations**: ❌ (Not implemented, as this is an advanced feature)

### Python API
- **`axe.grad(fn)` function**: ✅ (Implemented in `python/axe.py`)
- **`axe.value_and_grad(fn)`**: ✅ (Implemented in `python/axe.py`)
- **Enable/disable grad mode**: ✅ (A `no_grad` context manager is implemented in `python/axe.py` and connected to a C++ global flag)

### Test
- **Gradient of x^2 is 2x**: ✅ (Verified in `tests/test_autodiff.py` with the `test_grad_simple` test)
- **Gradients match finite differences**: ❌ (Not explicitly tested, but gradient correctness is verified by other tests)
- **Chain rule works**: ✅ (Verified in `tests/test_autodiff.py` with the `test_grad_chain_rule` test)
- **MILESTONE: Can train simple linear regression**: ✅ (Verified with the `test_linear_regression` test in `tests/test_autodiff.py`)

---

## ✅ PHASE 4: JIT Compiler - Part 1

### Tracing
- **Capture Python function calls**: ✅ (Tracing is implemented via operator overloads in `cpp/op.cpp` that interact with the JIT context)
- **Record operations into graph**: ✅ (The `JitGraph` class in `cpp/jit.cpp` correctly records a sequence of `TraceableOp`s)
- **Handle control flow (if/while)**: ❌ (Not implemented; this is an advanced feature beyond the scope of Part 1)
- **Build IR representation**: ✅ (The `JitGraph` and `TraceableOp` structs serve as a functional Intermediate Representation)

### Python Decorator
- **`@axe.jit` decorator**: ✅ (Implemented in `python/axe.py`)
- **Cache compiled functions**: ✅ (The decorator correctly caches graphs based on the signature of input tensor shapes and dtypes)
- **Handle different input shapes**: ✅ (The caching mechanism correctly triggers a re-trace for new input shapes)

### Test
- **JIT function runs correctly**: ✅ (Verified by `test_jit_correctness` in `tests/test_jit.py`)
- **Second call uses cache**: ✅ (Verified with mocking in `test_jit_caching` in `tests/test_jit.py`)
- **Compare speed vs non-JIT**: ❌ (No performance benchmarks are included in the test suite)
